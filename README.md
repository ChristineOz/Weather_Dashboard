# Weather_Dashboard

This page uses Open Weather Map APIs to gather information to display on the page. Once the user arrives, they can enter a valid city name which will then show the current day’s weather stats (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index) as well as the forecast for the next five days. The city will then be added to a previous search tab on the page. This history tab will display the names of every city searched but can be cleared as well. The previously searched cities will also be saved to local storage and be displayed if the user comes back to the page later. Clearing deletes the local storage items as well.
